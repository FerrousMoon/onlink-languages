cpu_speed_20: A slow and simple processor designed for use in parallel with many others, in large scale super-computers.

cpu_speed_60: An entry level processor, fitted as standard to all agent computers.

cpu_speed_80: A low budget, low speed processor.

cpu_speed_100: A reasonably fast processor, and a good upgrade choice for new agents.

cpu_speed_120: A faster processor with onboard MPU instruction handling for faster instruction execution.

cpu_speed_150: An entry level processor, fitted as standard to all agent computers.

cpu_speed_200: A high-speed accelerated processor with unique preemptive instruction handling, for use in high-priority critical systems.

cpu_speed_200+: A new processor from Darwin Research with nano-drive technology, allowing multiple processing components to fit in a single slot.

cpu_speed_500+: A new prototypical processor with enhanced nano-drive technology.
