    Welcome to the Uplink Tutorial.
    This program should help you to get started.
    Click next to continue.
  - |
    First things first - you can move this tutorial on the screen by left-clicking on the title bar.
    Right click to put it down again.
  - |
    We're going to start by looking at some of the facilities available on your screen.
    Click on the flashing CONNECTION MANAGER button.
  - This screen shows the connection manager and manual dialer for your Gateway. You can use this interface to connect to any computer system around the world.
  - We will discuss how to connect to systems later. For now, we will review other interfaces.
  - Click the flashing NOTEPAD button
  - Using this interface, you can start new notes for later reference. Saved notes will be sent to the lower right of your screen.
  - Click on the flashing HARDWARE button.
  - |
    This screen shows the status of your Gateway.
    Your gateway is the link between your home PC and the rest of the Net.
  - In reality, the gateway is a computer sitting in one of our offices. You'll dial into this Gateway automatically every time you start Uplink.
  - |
    At the moment your Gateway is very basic.
    It has a slow processor and very little memory.
    You'll be able to upgrade later.
  - Click on the flashing MEMORY BANKS button.
  - This screen shows all of the files you have stored in your memory banks. At the moment you only have this tutorial and a couple of file utilities.
  - Click on the flashing PERSONAL STATUS button.
  - |
    This screen shows your official ratings.
    These reflect your skill and success, and will no doubt increase with time.
  - As your rating increases, you'll find more interesting and profitable avenues of work become available to you.
  - Click on the flashing FINANCE button.
  - Here you can see how much money you have in your bank accounts.
  - Click on the flashing MISSIONS LIST button
  - |
    All the missions will be queued up here.
    For each you will be able to see the completion time limit and the mail subject.
  - |
    We will see more about missions in part 3.
    Click on the flashing EMAIL LIST button
  - All the emails you get will be queued up here. For each email, you can see the date and the subject.
  - To see the full content of an email you have to click on the one you want
  - You can delete one anytime by clicking the button on the top-right.
  - Click the flashing KEYMAP interface
  - |
    This interface is used to map the keys on your system to specific hooks.
    These hooks can be hud interfaces, software and even links.
    Link shortcuts will use your saved connection path.
  - |
    The top button allows you to create a new shortcut.
    The buttons around a shortcut allows you to edit or delete shortcuts.
  - |
    Shortcuts that are set in the options cannot be modified from here.
    You can however overwrite them.
  - Now close the KEYMAP interface
  - | 
    The big button to the left allows you to run the software tools on your Gateway.
    You can start any program from here.
  - These two boxes show the date and time, and your current location on the Net.
  - |
    These buttons can be used to accelerate time.
    This can be useful when you're waiting for something to happen.
  - |
    This column shows all currently running programs, and how much CPU time is used by each.
    You can see this tutorial program in the list.
  - Bring up the Global Communications screen by clicking on the world map.
  - |
    This screen allows you to set up long distance connections that bounce around the world.
    You'll make extensive use of this screen.
  - |
    We'll come back here later.
    Click the close button to return to the main screen.
  - Open the email list again and take the message with the '{{ Subject }}' subject.
  - |
    This is an email from Uplink Corporation.
    It is basically a welcome message. You should take the time to read it at some point.
  - |
    That is the end of Tutorial One. You should have an overview by now of the basic functions on screen.
    Click next to continue.
    
TestMissionContent:
  - |
    Welcome this section of the tutorial.
    We will now show you how to complete your first hack for Uplink.
  - |
    Your first hack will be the Uplink test mission.
    Open the missions list and click on the mission description to read the details
  - You should read the description carefully, but the basic aim is to break into the Uplink Test Machine and steal a file.
  - Disconnect from your current site.
  - |
    We're going to start by connecting to the target.
    Select 'Uplink Test Machine' from the list of bookmarked links on screen.
  - |
    You've connected to the wrong site.
    The one we want is the 'Uplink Test Machine'.
    Try again.
  - |
    We're now dialed in to the Test Machine.
    You should read the opening text message before clicking next.         
  - Click on the 'Start the test' button to bypass this screen.
  - This is a User ID screen. You will need a user name and password to get past, which we don't have.
  - |
    In reality, you will almost never have a genuine user name and password.
    You'll have to hack your way in.
  - |
    In order to hack our way in, we'll need to buy some software.
    Disconnect from this machine.
  - |
    The best place to buy software for hacking is the 'Uplink Internal Services System'.
    Connect to that site.
  - Unlike most sites, you do have a valid user name and password because you are a registered Uplink Agent.
  - |
    You can either type your username/password or just click on them to enter automatically.
    Do this now then click on proceed.
  - We're in. Your authorization has been accepted and your actions are being monitored by Uplink's central computer system.
  - This computer system provides a number of valuable services to the hacker community, including software tools which we need.
  - You can access Uplink-related news stories, accept work from contractors, and upgrade your computer system.
  - |
    We want to upgrade our software so we can hack UserID screens.
    Click on 'Software Market' from the menu.
  - This screen lists all of the software tools that Uplink currently has for sale. Items in grey are out of your price range.
  - |
    The first tool you will need is one of the basic Uplink Agent tools - 
    the Password Breaker.
  - Scroll down the list and select the Password Breaker. The current price for this tool is 1500 credits. Click 'purchase'.
  - |
    That software tool has now been uploaded into your memory banks, and 1500c have been deducted.
    We can now try breaking that password.
  - Disconnect from here and connect to the Uplink Test machine. Bypass the opening text screen.
  - We want to run our Password Breaker software on this screen. Our new software will appear in our Software menu.
  - Click on the software Run button.
  - Start your new Password Breaker by selecting it from the menu. It will be under the 'Crackers' sub-menu.
  - |
    The Password Breaker is now running.
    We now need to give it a target.
  - Click on the one of the text boxes labeled NAME or CODE. This will start the hack attempt.
  - Oh dear. You've been disconnected by the computer you were trying to hack into.
  - They noticed the fact that you were trying to hack their password screen, and kicked you off their system.
  - Because this is a TEST machine, you won't be punished in any way. In the real world, you could now face a fine or even jail time.
  - This tutorial will now show you how to hack into a computer without being caught in any way.
  - |
    The first thing we need is a warning system, so we can tell if they are about to catch us.
    We can buy software that will do this.
  - Connect to the Uplink Internal Services System and go to the Software Market menu, as before.
  - |
    Scroll down the list and click on 'Trace Tracker'.
    This item of software can tell you how close you are to being traced.
  - |
    There are several Versions of this item.
    Higher versions have more features but are more expensive.
  - |
    You can afford a Trace Tracker V2.0.
    Use the 'Next Version' button to select Version 2.0, then click on 'purchase'.
  - |
    You've now bought that item of software.
    You should run it straight away from the software menu, under 'Security'.
  - The Trace Tracker is now running. It is currently telling you that nobody is trying to trace your location at this time.
  - Having a warning system is a step in the right direction.
  - |
    One other tool we need for this mission is the File Copier.
    This tool is already provided on the gateway.
  - |
    While File Copier downloads any file, it requires you to target a memory slot to place the file in.
    You should experiment with it a little.
  - |
    If this limitation bothers you, feel free to purchase File Copier v2.
    This version will place a file in the first adequate memory slot.
  - |
    One last step is required for the hack.
    We need to slow down any traces that are being performed on us
  - We do this by 'Call Bouncing'. This involves extending our connection around the world, to confuse the opponent.
  - First, disconnect from this system.
  - Bring up the Global Communications map.
  - We need to establish a long distance connection to our target (the Uplink Test Machine), bounced through several intermediate systems.
  - |
    We build this connection by clicking on each of the intermediate nodes in sequence.
    Click on the location 'InterNIC'.
  - |
    Click on the location 'Uplink Public Access Server'.
    Click on the wrong location again if you made a mistake.
  - |
    Click on the location 'Uplink Internal Services System'.
    Click on the wrong location again if you made a mistake.
  - |
    Finally, click on the target 'Uplink Test Machine'.
    Click on the wrong location again if you made a mistake.
  - We've now set up a long distance connection to the target, bounced through three intermediate nodes.
  - It will take the opponent a lot longer to trace and disconnect us this time.
  - |
    On a side note, you might be interested in using the save and load button on the bottom left.
    they will allow you to preserve a bounce path.
  - |
    We are about to jump in.
    We will have little time to succeed but we can try again if time runs out.
  - |
    Check the mission description a final time.
    We are looking for a file named 'Uplink Test Data'.
  - |
    When you are ready,
    Click on 'Connect' to establish the link.
  - |
    Oh dear. We have been traced before we were able to complete the mission.
    Create another bounce to the Uplink Test Machine and try again.
  - Bypass the opening screen.
  - Start the password breaker now.
  - |
    Target the password box. As soon as you do this, they will begin tracing you.
    Click on Proceed when it has finished.
  - |
    We are in a menu.
    Click on the 'Access fileserver' button on the remote host.
  - Start the File Copier utility from your software menu, under 'File Utilities'
  - |
    Target the file in question by clicking on it.
    (Uplink Test Data)
  - |
    The file is now being copied.
    You can speed this up by clicking on this button at the top to divert more CPU time to this task.
  - |
    We've finished copying the file. We now want to dump it into our memory banks.
    Bring up the Memory banks screen.
  - Pick up the File Copier by clicking on it
  - |
    Now click on a clear area of memory to dump the file in to.
    Make space if you don't have enough.
  - We've now got the file. Disconnect from this computer system.
  - |
    Congratulation. You now have completed your first hack.
    Relax and enjoy your success.
  - In a real-world hack, we'd now have to make some attempt to delete the access logs that we've just left behind.
  - Every time you log on to a system, copy a file or make any changes, you leave behind access logs.
  - |
    These logs can be used by other Agents to trace you and put you in jail.
    You may even end up tracing another Agent one day.
  - |
    Back to the mission. Our final task is to send the copied file back to the customer.
    Bring up the mission description.
  - Click on 'reply'.
  - |
    We need to attach the stolen file to this email before we send it.
    Click on the File button and select 'Uplink Test Data'.
  - Now click on send.
  - |
    The mission has now been completed.
    You'll receive one email from Uplink.
  - It is congratulating you on completing the mission, and informing you that you've been paid. (In this case, nothing).
  - |
    For real missions, you may receive a second email.
    That one will inform you that your rating has gone up, and you'll now be able to do some more dangerous/profitable work.
  - You should now go to the Uplink Internal Services System and look through the work available to you.
  - |
    This is the end of this tutorial.
    In the next parts, you will learn to use the connection manager,
    and you'll learn how to start making money as an Uplink agent.

ConnectionManagerContent:
  - |
    Welcome in this section of the tutorial.
    The goal here is to learn to use a tool that will speed up bounces setup.
    Hopefully you have finished the Test mission and already know about bouncing.
  - Click on the connection manager...
  - This interface is split between a big main screen, and a side dialler on the right.
  - The dialler allows you to connect manually to a location. You can type in any IP of your choice.
  - Typically, you will rarely need to dial a system manually. There may be some instances however where doing so is required.
  - |
    On the main screen you can see two lists.
    The links that your system is aware of are displayed on the left list.
    The right list shows the bounce path that you might make. The top of this list is showing the end of the bounce.
  - Using the filters and the yanking buttons between the lists, you can push all the links you want to your bounce path.
  - |
    If you wish to add or remove a singular link, you can do so by double-clicking on it.
    The rest of the features are similar to that of the map.
  - |
    This is the end of this tutorial.
    You now have the option to choose the charm of setting up a bounce through the map,
    or the efficiency of the connection manager.

WhatToDoNextContent:
  - |
    Welcome in this section of the tutorial.
    Hopefully you've finished the Test mission.
    This part will show you what to do next.
  - |
    The Uplink Internal Services system is the place where you will find all of your future work.
    Connect there now.
  - Log in with your username and password.
  - |
    Uplink maintains a list of available missions.
    You can access this list by selecting 'Mission List' from the menu.
  - You should see a few missions that are available now. If you don't see any available missions, you can accelerate time until some appear.
  - You can use these buttons at the top of the screen to accelerate time until a mission becomes available.
  - Each time you successfully complete a mission, you'll be paid and your Uplink rating will go up.
  - |
    As your rating goes up, more missions will appear.
    Employers are more likely to offer more dangerous missions and more pay as your rating gets higher.
  - In addition, your Neuromancer rating is affected by the types of missions you do. This rating is effectively a record of your moral values.
  - You may find employees are unwilling to give you certain missions if your Neuromancer rating is too low.
  - Each mission has to be completed under a certain time limit. If you don't respect the dead-line, the mission will fail.
  - The time limit might be modified according to your choices. Asking all the money before doing the mission will shorten the time length allowed.
  - Exit out from the Mission screen.
  - Uplink Corporation maintains a large database of useful information on the subject of hacking and computer security.
  - Select 'Help' from the menu.
  - As you attempt more complex missions, you will undoubtedly run into more complex security systems.
  - All of the information we have on these systems is kept in these help pages. If you get stuck, this is the place to look for data.
  - You may learn that you need some new software or a hardware upgrade.
  - |
    This is not the only place where you can find help.
    Uplink Laboratories also provide some useful tips on the newest security systems
  - Exit out from the Help screen.
  - Once you are working on the harder missions, you will find your current Gateway is too limiting.
  - |
    You may need faster CPU capabilities,
    more memory capacity or bandwidth,
    or more personal security.
  - Select 'Gateway Market' from the menu.
  - |
    This screen shows all of the Gateways that you can buy from Uplink Corporation.
    Currently you have the first one off the list.
  - |
    After a few missions you'll be able to afford to upgrade.
    Your old Gateway is part-exchanged, so you can work up the list slowly.
  - |
    Uplink Corporation does not store any records on who is using which Gateway.
    This means that your Gateway can be traced, but you are safe.
  - If you are traced during a hack, we will be forced to seize your accounts and Gateway.
  - This means you'll have to start from the bottom of the Gateway list again when you rejoin.
  - |
    Later gateways have room for your own Security.
    You can install cameras and motion sensors which will give you early warning of trouble.
  - |
    If you destroy your gateway before it is seized, you can normally save your accounts and name.
    However you will of course lose your Gateway.
  - |
    This is the end of this tutorial.
    You should have a good idea of what to do next.
    Uplink Corp. wishes you luck for the future.
