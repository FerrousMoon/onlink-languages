Subject: Hackers take advantage of Global Criminal Database

Body: |
    The Government owned Global Criminal Database system has recently suffered a couple of high security hacks, and it would seem more and more hackers are taking advantage of the system.
    
    For the third time in less than a month a hacker gained administrative access to the system and modified criminal records within the system.
    
    This occurred on {{date_time}}.
    
    The Government now believes a group of individuals are offering modifications to personal records such as criminal records for a price, perhaps advertising through the underground anarchist group Uplink Corporation.
    
    The Government has now clamped down on accesses to the system, claiming it is safer than ever.
