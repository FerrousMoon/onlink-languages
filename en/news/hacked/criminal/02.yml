Subject: Criminal Records opened to the public domain

Body: |
    Despite the installation of a brand new high security system, the Global Criminal Database has again been attacked and penetrated by a hacker or group of hackers.
    
    Government agents are said to be amazed that their new system has failed so soon.
    
    This occurred on {{date_time}}.
    
    This is the second time criminal records have been modified by hackers masquerading as officers.
    
    The newly installed system will no doubt be tested in light of this new breach.
