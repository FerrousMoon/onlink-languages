Subject: Government run academic database hacked

Body: |
    The International Academic Database has been compromised by malicious hacker.
    
    Until today this system was thought to be secure against this type of attack.
    
    This occurred on {{date_time}}.
    
    The motives of the hacker are not clear but it is thought he was attempting to forge qualifications for an unknown recipient.
