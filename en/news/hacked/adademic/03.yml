Subject: Government academic database hacked again

Body: |
    The Government is on the defensive again today as its International Academic Database is hacked again.
    
    This attack comes less than a week after a recent hack and is the third this month.
    
    This occurred on {{date_time}}.
    
    It is believed that an individual or small group is attempting to create new academic details and qualifications, perhaps offering this as a service.
    
    Federal agents have been brought in to investigate.
