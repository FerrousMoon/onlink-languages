Subject: Government held Files compromised for the third time

Body: |
    For the third time in less than a month, the government owned Social Security Database has been hacked.
    
    This occurred on {{date_time}}.
    
    The system holds key personal data on millions of people and has been the cause of some embarrassment recently for the government.
    
    The potential for damage on this system is huge, prompting calls by opposition parties for a full review of all security protocols.
