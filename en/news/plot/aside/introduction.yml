Subject: Former Top Uplink Agent Found Dead in Home

Body: |
    Earlier today, a man by the name of Jesse Wilson was found dead from a self-inflicted 
    gunshot wound to the head. Federal agents have stated that at this time they do not 
    expect foul play though no suicide note was found at the scene.
    
    Wilson was once known as Musana in the underground hacking scene and was believed to 
    have been deeply involved with Uplink Corporation up until the year 2018, when he left 
    the Corporation, citing family reasons.
    
    Miah Taylor, who it is believed worked closely with Wilson both during and after his 
    tenure with Uplink Corporation, has stated that he will be holding a private funeral for 
    close friends and family of Mr. Wilson.
    
    The Wilson family has been unavailable for comment at this time. However, a spokesperson 
    of Ferrous Moon issued a press release from the eastern Europe headquarter located in Athens:
    
    "Jesse Wilson was a fine person, and we here at Ferrous Moon mourn the passing of such an 
    intelligent, personable man. We don't know why he would do such a thing; he did good work 
    as a private contractor with us and never gave indication to any sort of problems. Our 
    hearts and prayers go out to Jesse's family."
    
    Federal agents have stated that they will conduct an investigation looking into the
    apparent suicide of Wilson, citing that the Wilson family deserves some sort of closure.
