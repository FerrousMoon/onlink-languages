    Arunmor Corporation have been working hard on researching the recently discovered Revelation project, and have released details of their findings.
    
    "Revelation is the most destructive computer virus we have ever seen" said the CEO of Arunmor Corporation earlier today. "At first we thought it was targeted specifically at us. It has now become clear that the aim of Revelation is to totally destroy the Internet, from the inside."
    
    "Once released, it will spread like wildfire to all the main systems, then eventually to the entire Internet, destroying everything in its path. Its payload is extremely well designed and will take down any system it comes up against."
    
    "We will be posting missions on the Uplink BBS mission board. Any agents that can help us will be well rewarded, and will be fighting for a good cause."
    
    "The offer of 25000c for any data on related to Revelation is still open, and will remain open for the next 48 hours."
    
    "Our Faith project is now aiming to provide a counter-virus that will stop Revelation in its tracks."
    
    Federal Agents today began an investigation into the activities of Andromeda Research Corporation.
