Subject: Arunmor Security scare - a special report

Body: |
    Earlier today Arunmor Corporation shut down all of its primary computer systems and disconnected their Internal Network from the web. The disconnection lasted just under one hour, and caused a great deal of disruption to Internet traffic flowing through their systems.
    
    Arunmor says they had received word that they were about to be attacked by a group of hackers working for the controversial Andromeda Research Corporation. So far Arunmor has not said why they suspect this company. It is believed they had some kind of inside information.
    
    This latest accusation casts Andromeda Research Corporation in an increasingly bad light.
