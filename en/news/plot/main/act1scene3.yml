Subject: High ranking Agent raises doubts over ARC

Body: |
    One of the top ranking Uplink Agents has broken the silence over the recent activity of ARC (Andromeda Research Corporation) and raised doubts over the morality of the work being done.
    
    The announcement comes less than a month after ARC began recruiting all the top agents for work on some unspecified project.
    
    The agent in question, known as Agent {{agent_handle}}, is on one of the top ranked Agents in the world and is well respected throughout the hacker community.
    
    Agent {{agent_handle}} stated: "We don't know anything about this company ARC - some of the work that I've seen done for them is highly suspicious and could be used in a very destructive manner if properly exploited. ARC is relying on the unofficial code of honour of Uplink Agents - that they won't discuss what they were working on. Someone needs to come forward and explain what this company is up to."
    
    Once again, ARC refused to comment, but did say that a press release was imminent.
