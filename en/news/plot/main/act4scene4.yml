Subject: ARC Internal Services System attacked

Body: |
    The Internal Services System run by Andromeda Research Corporation (ARC) has been penetrated by an unknown hacker. This did not come to light until a few hours ago, when system administrators noticed a discrepancy in the access logs on the system.
    
    "This is the latest example of the kind of abuse our company is having to deal with" said the public relations officer of ARC. "Ever since these ridiculous allegations about us developing some doomsday weapon, we have had serious problems attracting new business. Now this."
    
    It is not known what the hacker did - he was very careful and covered his tracks. ARC are launching a full investigation into this incident.
