Body: |
    The Leader of the Andromeda group today issued a statement through his lawyer, regarding his recent arrest for criminal damage to the Web. In it he outlines why he tried to destroy the Internet that we all rely on.
    
    "Firstly, I make no apologies for what I have done. My only regret is that I did not succeed" says the man, who has not yet been identified by Federal Agents.
    
    "The Internet used to be a place of amazing opportunity and promise - the last remnant of free speech and true anonymity. Now it is little more than an extension of the evil of Western Capitalism."
    
    "Think of this. Do you have any idea how much money Arunmor will make from recent events? This is why I tried to destroy the Internet. It only serves to line the pockets of those who would try to control us."
    
    "While the Web exists, you will never be safe. Your entire life is on file, waiting for somebody to tamper with it. Your lives are being destroyed by the Computers you desperately try to defend."
    
    It is believed this man will spend several years in jail for this crime.
