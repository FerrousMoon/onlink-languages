Subject: Revelation virus outbreak leaves systems crippled

Body: |
    The Revelation computer virus has been released into the wild and has spread rapidly through major computer systems around the world. A massive amount of damage has been done, and reports are still coming in from systems that have been literally wiped clean by the virus.
    
    However, Arunmor Corporation have been developing a counter virus known as Faith for the past few weeks with the aid of Government assistance, and have managed to stop the Revelation Virus from spreading any further.
    
    Federal Agents busted into Andromeda Research Corporation shortly after the virus outbreak and arrested staff members suspected of involvement. A number of computer systems were also seized. This coincided with a world wide effort to take down this rogue group within Andromeda Research Corporation. A number of Uplink agents were also arrested in connection with the outbreak.
    
    It is not known what will become of Andromeda, but it is clear that many of the company executives have come to the end of their career at that company.
    
    Federal Agents refused to comment at this time, but did say a statement would be released soon.
