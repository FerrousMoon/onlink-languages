Subject: Formal warning issued by Uplink Corporation

Body: |
    Uplink Corporation has issued a formal warning to all of its agents, warning them against accepting work for Andromeda Research Corporation (ARC).
    
    In a statement released today, they say "Uplink Corporation is currently investigating the claim that ARC have been developing some kind of high-tech weapon, using the expertise of freelance Uplink agents to assist them. Federal agents have been called in to assist and are also pursuing the matter of a recent suicide, which they believe may have been a related murder."
    
    "Until we can determine if these charges have any truth in them, we must insist that all Uplink Agents refuse any work being offered to them from ARC or anyone working for that company. Anyone caught working for this company will lose their Uplink status immediately."
