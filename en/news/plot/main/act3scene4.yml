Subject: Federal Agents release findings on ARC

Body: |
    Federal Agents today made their first public announcement on their investigation into Andromeda Research Corporation (ARC).
    
    "Our investigation so far has uncovered a number of disturbing facts, however no concrete evidence has yet been discovered" said a Federal Spokesman. "It would appear that ARC are developing a software tool in an attempt to damage the operation of the Internet. So far no evidence has been found and no witnesses have come forward to back this up."
    
    "It is our belief that ARC were responsible for the murder of {person_name} and possibly one other, but until we acquire evidence we will be unable to act in any legal way."
    
    "Most importantly, we have determined that Andromeda Research Corporation is privately owned and controlled by the secretive group "Andromeda", and that the CEO and the Managing Director of ARC are both core members of this group. Our profile of Andromeda lists them as well funded Anti-Capitalist Techno-Anarchists, which would seem to fit the charges against them. So far, we have not had any success in finding this group."
    
    "Their only real-world presence that we are aware of is their Public Access Terminal, but the registered contact details of that site are all fake."
    
    "We intend to continue our investigation and appeal for anyone with any information to come forward."
