Subject: Unusual hiring practices noticed by analysts

Body: |
    Andromeda Research Corporation, otherwise known as ARC, have been extremely busy lately.
    
    The company has been hiring all of the top Uplink Agents for the past couple of weeks, sometimes posting several missions in one day.
    
    Details are thin but it appears that the work done is very vague in nature - ARC are keeping quiet about the ultimate goal of this work and all of the Agents involved are sworn to secrecy. Analysts predict that ARC has spent over fifty-thousand credits in the last week alone on agent fees.
    
    At the time of writing, ARC was unwilling to comment.
