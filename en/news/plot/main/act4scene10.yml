Subject: Digital Life research stolen

Body: |
    Earlier today a hacker penetrated the Local Area Network of Darwin Research Associates and stole Gigaquads of data on their latest project - Darwin Digital Life. It is not known exactly what the hackers wanted the data for, since its use is described as purely theoretical.
    
    "The idea behind Darwin Digital Life was to create a life form that could live and reproduce on the Internet," the media represenative of Darwin Research Associates said recently. "Obviously we are gutted that somebody has stolen what amounts to years of research into this area."
    
    A suspect has been named to Federal Agents, but so far no arrests have been made. Darwin Research Associates earlier today stated that an Uplink Agent was responsible, and that the Agent in question was working for Andromeda Research Corporation (ARC) at the time.
    
    Once again, ARC was unwilling to comment on the issue, but this latest allegation has fueled speculation as to the ultimate motives of the company.
