Subject: ARC Central Mainframe compromised

Body: |
    Industry experts have expressed surprise at the discovery that the ARC central Mainframe was yesterday hacked wide open, and over 50 Gigaquads of data was stolen. The system has come under attack many times recently because of ARC's alleged involvement in the construction of some kind of digital weapon, but it was previously believed to be impenetrable.
    
    The ARC central mainframe stores most of its critical data on a stand-alone file server, which is physically disconnected from the rest of the Internet. This ingenious system has stopped all previous attempts at access.
    
    "We now know that somebody inside our company betrayed us," stated ARCs public relations officer in a press release this morning. "We have found equipment which suggests somebody temporarily connected the file server to the outside world with a remote link, which left the file server open to access for a few minutes. They must have been working with somebody on the outside to pull this off."
