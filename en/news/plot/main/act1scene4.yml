Subject: Top Uplink Agent re-assures community

Body: |
    In a surprising development in the mystery of Andromeda Research Corporation (ARC), the number one rated Uplink Agent "{{agent_handle}}" has come forward to re-assure the community.
    
    This comes two days after another high ranking Uplink Agent publicly expressed concern that ARC were hiring agents to work on some kind of weapon.
    
    Agent {{agent_handle}} says in their statement: "I have been working for ARC on a confidential project for the past two weeks. The project is immensely ambitious in nature but is nothing to worry about. ARC have been keeping the public in the dark to protect their trade secrets. Uplink Agents should not be afraid of accepting jobs from this company."
    
    "Some people have said they think ARC are building some kind of military weapon - I can say that I have had full access to the ARC Central Mainframe for the past week and there is nothing of the sort on the system. What they are doing is being kept under wraps but it is definitely not a weapon."
    
    Agent {{agent_handle}} is a well respected hacker with years of experience and their comments will certainly re-assure the community.
