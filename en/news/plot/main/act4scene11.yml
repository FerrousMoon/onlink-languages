Subject: Arunmor Corporation in Financial Fraud

Body: |
    The lead Technical director of Arunmor Corporation has been arrested by Federal Agents, following allegations that he has been caught attempting bank fraud. This latest development in the Arunmor Versus ARC story has called into question the true motives behind Arunmor Corporation.
    
    Federal Agents arrested the technical director in a dawn raid, after an anonymous tip led them to discover evidence which immediately incriminated him.
    
    So far he has protested his innocence, claiming he has been framed.
    
    This arrest will come as a severe blow to Arunmor Corporation, who relied on this man for most of their technical leadership. Their so called "Faith Project" will have been set back.
