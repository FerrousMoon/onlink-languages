Body: |
    Following the recent attempted attack on the Arunmor computer network, Arunmor have announced that they have begun work on a new project - dubbed "Faith". The aim of this project is to stop the release of destructive computer viruses onto the Net.
    
    A company spokesman said "We cannot allow any virus, including the so called Revelation virus, to roam freely around our corporate networks. Project Faith will actively seek out Revelation and other destructive viruses, and will totally eradicate them. At this moment we are seeking Government assistance as this project could help everyone. The recent attempted attack on our network highlighted how weak Internet security is. We intend to put a stop to this."
    
    Arunmor has taken the unprecedented step of offering a reward of 25000 credits to anyone who can help them with their research into Revelation. Anyone with any data related to this virus should send it to internal@arunmor.net to claim their reward.
