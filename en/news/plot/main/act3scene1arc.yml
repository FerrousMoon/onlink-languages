Subject: Arunmor virus outbreak - a special report

Body: |
    Arunmor Corporation recently suffered an attack from a new computer virus, currently being dubbed by industry experts as "Revelation".
    
    This virus has never been seen before and contains a payload capable of destroying almost any computer it is used against. Currently the virus does not appear to spread particularly fast and it is limited to systems owned by the target company, but it is believed that whoever is responsible is probably still working on improving it.
    
    Recently a high ranking Uplink Agent contacted us and suggested that Andromeda Research Corporation might be connected to this viral outbreak. Agents have been assigned the task of investigating.
