Subject: Personal customer data copied by hacker

Body: |
    A computer hacker entered the Central File Server of {{company_name}} today and copied a huge portion of computer data to an unknown location. This incident comes less than a month after a similar incident where their central mainframe was compromised.
    
    The computer system stored hundreds of GigaQuads of personal data on all of the corporation's customers. This data is now in the public domain. Over {{misc_numeric}} Gigaquads of data was stolen.
    
    {{company_name}} tried to reassure the public today, and issued a statement saying they had brought in Federal Agents to try and find the corporation responsible.
