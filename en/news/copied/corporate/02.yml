Body: |
    A computer hacker entered the Central File Server of {{company_name}} today and copied a huge portion of computer data to an unknown location. This incident comes less than a month after a similar incident where their central mainframe was compromised.
    
    It is believed around {{misc_numeric}} Gigaquads of confidential corporate data was stolen by this hacker, and it was probably copied to a temporary fileserver somewhere on the web.
    
    {{company_name}} have said that they are considering all options to catch this hacker, and the corporation that paid for it.
