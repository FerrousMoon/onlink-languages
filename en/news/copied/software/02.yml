Subject: Two years of software development - stolen

Body: |
    A computer hacker entered the Central File Server of {{company_name}} today and copied a huge portion of computer data to an unknown location. This incident comes less than a month after a similar incident where their central mainframe was compromised.
    
    {{company_name}} had been working on several advanced software products and this computer system was their primary file server. Most of their proprietary source code has been copied - over {{misc_numeric}} Gigaquads of data, immediately compromising several of their planned security systems.
    
    Federal Agents have been called in to help track down the Corporation and the hacker responsible.
