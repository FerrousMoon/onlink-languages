Subject: Digital World Destroyed

Body: |
    Darwin Research Associates have confirmed that they suffered a breach earlier today. The attacker broke into the organisation's project server and destroyed critical files relating to their digital life project, constituting over a decade's worth of accumulated research. Core files for the digital world known as Darwinia are feared to be completely lost. Doctor Sepulveda, the director and project leader of the Darwinia project, has since gone missing amid fears that the loss of the project may have been too much for him to bear.
    
    In a landmark statement published shortly after the news of the attack broke, Uplink Corporation made it clear that they would turn over any agents involved with the destruction of the data over to the authorities. This is the first time that Uplink has ever threatened to reveal the real identities of any of its agents.
