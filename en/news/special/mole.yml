Subject: Multiple Uplink Agent murders reported

Body: |
    Federal Agents today announced they were investigating a series of murders and suicides, all involving active or retired Uplink Agents. Within the last two days, eight Uplink Agents of various skill levels have been executed or have committed suicide.
    
    Federal agents are keeping quiet about the identities of those agents killed, and have not suggested any connecting factor other than the fact that they all worked freelance for Uplink Corporation.
    
    Murders of Uplink Agents are rare - Uplink Corporation is very careful at making sure the agent handles are never converted into real-world people, effectively providing anonymity for their agents.
