Subject: Government run Nuclear Defense system compromised

Body: |
    It emerged today that a high-profile experimental Government computer system was very nearly fooled into starting World War III. The system began receiving information that major cities were being attacked by enemy Nuclear Weapons. The system raised the defense status to DEFCON 2 before somebody pulled the plug.
    
    "Its not yet clear how this happened" commented a senior member of the military. "However we do know that a hacker was involved, probably playing some kind of prank on the world. Let me tell you this - that prank nearly wiped out the Western Hemisphere."
