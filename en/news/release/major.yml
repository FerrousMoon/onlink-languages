    The {[man|woman]} in question is {{person_name}} and {[he|she]} was thought to be a well established member of the secretive underground hacker movement Uplink-Corporation, where {[he|she]} worked behind the hacker alias of {{agent_handle}}. Police have had a file on this {[man|woman]} for several years and finally caught {[him|her]} red handed.
