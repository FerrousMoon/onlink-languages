Name: Muhard's Chaos Library Extension Pack
Type: SystemUpgrade

Description: |
   A kernel extension which allows very fast complex number calculation that would otherwise in a stand alone program be too slow to allow call-and-response systems.
   
   This extension also enables a random bounce point generator in your connection map.
