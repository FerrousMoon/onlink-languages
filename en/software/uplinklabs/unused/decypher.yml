Name: Decypher
Type: Cracker

Description: |
   This version adds the ability to analyse the Savant Cypher. This algorithm is not likely to perfectly relock the set, so user interaction will be required. A database of cypher collisions is packaged with the program to show possible solutions. ChaosLib and MasterKey are required.
