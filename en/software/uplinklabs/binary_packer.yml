Name: Binary Packer
Type: FileUtility

Description: |
   Compresses any binary file as much as 50%. This version comes with a new packing algorithm to allow compression of binary formats. Due to the natural of such formats, binary files will not be be able to be natively run while compressed.
   Non-binary data may be packed with this program, but is not efficient for that purpose.
