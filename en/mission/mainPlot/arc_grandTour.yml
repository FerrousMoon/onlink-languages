Subject: Release the Revelation Virus into the wild
Body: |
    In your email inbox you will see two emails from us - one containing the final version of the Revelation virus, and the other containing a tracker which will list the systems currently infected.
    
    This is your green light Agent {{ player_handle }} - we have selected you as our most successful freelance agent to carry out our final mission. Your aim is simple - release Revelation onto as many systems as you possibly can before our entire company is shut down by Federal Agents.
    
    Arunmor have Faith ready - they will be right behind you. If you are quick enough, you will be able to spread the virus faster than they can stop it. Revelation will infect a system, scan for nearby systems on the same subnet, then migrate to the nearest two of those systems. At the same time it will destroy the host it originated from. Once a certain number of systems have been disabled, the growth of the virus will be unstoppable and the entire Internet will suffer a system-wide cascade failure.
    
    This is the end - if you are successful there will be no more Uplink Corporation, no more ARC and no more Arunmor. The entire Internet will come down with us. Think about it - we can destroy all records of ownership, reset everyone back to square one, crash the whole damn system. Think of it!
    
    This will be our last message to you - if all goes to plan, we will never speak again.
    
    The codename for this mission is GrandTour. Best of luck. ARC out.
