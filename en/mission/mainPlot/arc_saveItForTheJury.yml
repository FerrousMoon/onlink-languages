Subject: Frame the chief tech of Arunmor Corporation
Body: |
    We have decided that it is time to get personal. The chief technical director of Arunmor Corporation, {[Mr|Ms]} {{ person_name }}, has recently excelled in {[his|her]} line of work."
    
    {[He|She]} has managed to make a number of breakthrough's in their research into Revelation, and no doubt {[his|her]} presence at Arunmor has increased the power of their rival virus Faith. We have decided that his life should now come to an effective end.
    
    In addition, we'd like to strike a blow to Arunmor's public image as well. As such, we'd like you to frame their chief tech for something particularly nasty - Bank Fraud.
    
    Break in to the bank below, and start messing around. Make sure they notice you. Then break in to one of your relay systems and modify the logs so that {{ person_name }} is incriminated.
    
    To do this, you'll need to make the log point back to {[his|her]} home computer - address below.
    
    Codename: SaveItForTheJury
    
    TARGET BANK :
    {{ computer_name }}
    IP: {{ computer_ip }}
    
    Target individual :
    {{ person_name }}
    {[His|Her]} personal computer: {{ target_ip }}

OnFailure:
    Subject: Failure to complete mission
    Body: You don't appear to have done the hack or framed the man in question.

OnNotCompleted:
    Subject: The wrong person has been framed
    Body: |
        We've looked at the systems involved, and we can see that you have performed the hack.
        
        However, it doesn't appear that the logs lead back to his home computer. You must fix this before somebody traces the wrong person.

OnCompleted:
    Subject: Congratulations
    Body: |
        Well done Agent - we have checked the systems ourselves and have determined that enough evidence has been planted to convict the man. Police will soon be receiving an anonymous tip, which should end his work at Arunmor.
        
        We are planning on using this instance to cast doubt over the actions of Arunmor Corporation. Currently they are receiving a great deal of funding from the Government and are making very fast progress on their Faith counter-virus. This has become something of an arms race. Hopefully the Government will be less willing to fund such an operation when they hear about this financial scandal.
