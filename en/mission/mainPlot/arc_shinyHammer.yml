Subject: Destroy all research completed by Arunmor
Body: |
    We are getting tired of racing against Arunmor Corporation, and recently their Faith project has been performing well against Revelation. We need to put a stop to this. Since the CEO of our company was arrested, Arunmor have been catching up with our research every day.
    
    This mission is designed to be a crushing blow to the research efforts of Arunmor Corporation.
    
    We know from our inside sources that Arunmor keep all of their research on their Local Area Network, and that it is heavily guarded. The fact that they leave this system open to the Internet will be their undoing.
    
    Your task is simple. Find their Local Area Network, break in to it, and delete all the files you find. Then take down the entire system.

    You will encounter severe resistance. We are prepared to pay you {{ mission_payment }} credits for completion of this mission. If you succeed, we believe we will be able to take advantage of their momentary confusion and launch Revelation successfully.
    
    Be patient...the time is near.

            We've just heard the news about Arunmor's research - congratulations!
            
            It looks like you performed the job with your usual style and skill. Well done.
            
            Faith is certain to take a major blow from this. We are planning on releasing Revelation very shortly...there are just a few more things to take care of first.
            
            It is likely that Arunmor had some backups of the counter-virus somewhere, so we will have to move quickly to take advantage of their loss.
            
            We will contact you soon.

            Congratulations on deleting the data on Arunmor's Local Area Network. It appears you didn't quite manage to shut down the system, but that's ok. We've dealt them a nasty blow. We are planning on releasing Revelation very shortly...there are just a few more things to take care of first.
                         
            We will contact you soon.

            Well done for attempting the Arunmor crash mission. It appears you shut down the system, which will cause them problems. But it appears they have recovered the data from their main system.
            
            You should have deleted all the files before you shut the system down.
            
            Still, this will hurt Arunmor. We are planning on releasing Revelation very shortly...there are just a few more things to take care of first.
            
            We will contact you soon.
