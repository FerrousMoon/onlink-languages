Subject: Destroy all research completed by Arunmor
Body: |
    We are getting tired of racing against Arunmor Corporation, and recently their Faith project has been performing well against Revelation. We need to put a stop to this. Since the CEO of our company was arrested, Arunmor have been catching up with our research every day.
    
    This mission is designed to be a crushing blow to the research efforts of Arunmor Corporation.
    
    We know from our inside sources that Arunmor keep all of their research on their Local Area Network, and that it is heavily guarded. The fact that they leave this system open to the Internet will be their undoing.
    
    Your task is simple. Find their Local Area Network, break in to it, and delete all the files you find. Then take down the entire system.

    You will encounter severe resistance. We are prepared to pay you {{ mission_payment }} credits for completion of this mission. If you succeed, we believe we will be able to take advantage of their momentary confusion and launch Revelation successfully.
    
    Be patient...the time is near.
