Subject: ARC has been busted
Body: |
    We know you're busy, so we'll make this brief.
    
    We've just been informed that Federal Agents have broken into ARCs headquarters and have arrested the staff and seized the equipment there.
    
    This means that no further outbreaks of Revelation will occur.
    
    If you can stop the current outbreak from spreading, we will have beaten them. This is our best chance to put an end to the Revelation threat once and for all.
    
    Do your best and hurry.
    
    [END]
