    That looks like a total success to us. We'll have to keep quiet for a while, but it looks like the Feds are getting ready to arrest the CEO of Andromeda Research Corporation tomorrow.
    
    It also looks like we are going to be able to question him about Revelation. This is going to help our cause.
    
    We believe that the CEO of Andromeda Corporation is not actually the man in charge of the Revelation project - since ARC is actually owned by the Andromeda group, and their leader is currently unknown. However, he undoubtedly has a strong impact on their progress.
    
    If we are very lucky, this man will help us find the leader of Andromeda.
    
    It is also likely that our funding will be increased due to this outbreak. The Government is getting quite desperate at the moment - they think their entire infrastructure may be destroyed, and we are the only people who can offer them a solution.
