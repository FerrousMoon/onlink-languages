    So it seems that you were working for the enemy behind our backs all this time. You cannot imagine how surprised we were when we heard that Arunmor had received a complete copy of Revelation, and that it was an Uplink Agent who was the source. Unfortunately for you, you are the only Uplink Agent who could have sent them this copy. This makes you our new enemy.
    
    Take this message however you want - but Andromeda Research Corporation will not let this betrayal go unpunished. We'll be watching you, and when we finally come after you, you're going to wish you had never heard of Arunmor Corporation or Uplink.
