    Let us be the first to congratulate you Agent - we have been totally unable to recover Revelation from our damaged machines and we had been hoping that somebody out there would have a copy of it.
    
    Of course, we won't ask where you got it, nor will we let it become known who sent it too us.
    
    Thanks to your submission, we will now be able to pull several weeks ahead of Revelation. We have already deposited the full reward of {{ misc_numeric }}c into your account.
    
    We may have some more work for you in future.
    
    Once again thank you for your contribution to project Faith.

    Thank you for your recent submission of the Revelation virus, and congratulations on finding such a rare item. Unfortunately, we already have a copy of this version of the virus, so what you have sent is will not prove useful.
    
    As such, we are unable to pay you any reward. If you find any newer versions, please send them to us.
