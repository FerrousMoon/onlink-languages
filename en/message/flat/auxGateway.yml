Subject: Your Auxiliary Gateway
Body: |
    Uplink Corporation has arranged the allocation of an auxiliary gateway for your use. The gateway is ready for use right away, and a link to it has been included with this message.
    
    It should be noted that auxiliary gateways do not accept connections from outside the Uplink network and should you be disavowed, you will be unable to connect to your auxiliary gateway.
