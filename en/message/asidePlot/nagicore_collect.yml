    Our consultant informs us that the file "nagicore.cpp", in Taylor's 
    databank, does not match any projects Ferrous Moon is doing. It's a 
    bit of a long shot, but it's possible that the file might be worth 
    investigating. Copy it over to your databank and email it to us when 
    we're done here.
    
    
    We don't think you're going to find anything else here without alerting 
    him to your presence. Go ahead and send nagicore.cpp to us, and we'll credit 
    your account with the remainder of your commission.
