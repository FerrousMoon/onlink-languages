    We've noticed your progress here at Uplink, and would like to offer you a 
    private contract directly from us.
    
    As you've undoubtedly seen, shortly after your arrival at Uplink, one of our 
    very best former agents took his own life for reasons that we cannot explain. 
    To put it simply, we're not entirely satisfied with the federal investigation's 
    conclusion citing financial problems. Wilson was employed through Ferrous Moon, 
    which has a history of looking after their own in situations like this, and 
    we're certain that they would have looked after Wilson given his expertise and 
    background with their directing staff.
    
    What we are about to ask you to do will put both you and ourselves at risk. 
    While you are not the highest ranking agent within our association, you are the 
    highest ranking agent that would have no reason to inform our target. Simply put, 
    you do not have the personal ties that most of our otherwise-qualified agents have.
    
    As you are probably aware, Miah Taylor was the Vice Director of Uplink before 
    resigning to found and manage his company Ferrous Moon. Many of our agents that 
    choose to transfer to the safer public sector find themselves working with Ferrous 
    Moon, either permanently or until other employment makes itself available. Wilson 
    was no exception; At the height of his career, he was receiving missions directly 
    from Taylor on behalf of our board of directors.
    
    Shortly after Wilson's death, federal agents sought to obtain a warrant to search 
    the Ferrous Moon corporate headquarters. They were unsuccessful after one of Ferrous 
    Moon's legal team was, as we understand, "very persuasive" with the presiding 
    judge. The warrant request was subsequently denied.
    
    This strikes us as peculiar. While the denial of the warrant was not exactly 
    unexpected, the fact that one of the Ferrous Moon legal team showed up was. 
    Throughout countless such requests, even those potentially more damning, they have 
    never bothered to send their legal team to stop it in this force before.
    
    What we ask of you is no small task. We want you to break into the former Vice 
    Director's personal computer and see if you can find anything that may seem out of 
    place. Please note that Taylor has developed a number of proprietary systems to protect 
    important data, and you may find yourself in for a hell of a trip. Just remember this 
    from the old spy's manual: sometimes the best place to hide something is in plain sight.
    
    This mission is entirely up to you. We have laid all of our cards down. It's time to 
    make your move. We will not reprimand you if you refuse. Certainly you would be putting 
    yourself at grave risk if you are caught, but we will offer {{ misc_numeric }}c up front if you accept, 
    and an additional {{ misc_string }}c upon completion. Due to the sensitive nature of this operation, 
    we will be watching you while you execute this contract, in case you miss something. We will 
    not monitor you until you respond, if you choose to do so.
    
    We hope to hear from you.
