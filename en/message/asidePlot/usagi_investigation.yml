Subject: Our continuing investigation
Body: |
    Taylor has a suspiciously copious amount of emails from "Usagi". 
    It's too bad they're encrypted - we'd like to know what the two 
    were actually conversing about.
    
    We think this "Usagi" is an ex-Agent of ours - the alias is a 
    little too familiar. If so, her real name is Marie Gunsolus, and 
    she left Uplink for unspecified reasons in 2019. It's very likely 
    she went to work for Ferrous Moon - the many emails between her 
    and Taylor indicate some level of familiarity between the two.
    
    We want you to investigate her as you did Taylor. Check the 
    Ferrous Moon Name Server to see if you can get her personal 
    computer's IP address; then, go have a look around. We'll deposit 
    75000c to your account if you can relay anything suspicious on 
    Usagi's computer back to us.
    
    And, just like before, don't do anything unnecessary. Usagi's 
    most likely in good graces with Taylor - and we don't want him 
    to suspect anyone from Uplink of doing anything untoward.
    
    Best of luck, Agent.
